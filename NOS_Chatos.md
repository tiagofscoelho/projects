## Other information
 The project will be a proof of concept. 
 One of the main goals is to add an add-on/plugin in NOS TV Box that will display the chat along side the real time TV. Users will be able to sign up/in in our mobile app with NOS account credentials.
 Unfortunately, we can not do that with the current API access and tools that were provided.
